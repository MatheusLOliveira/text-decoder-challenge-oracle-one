# üîç Text Decoder - Challenge Oracle ONE

This project is a text decoder developed as part of the OracleNext Education Challenge in collaboration with Alura.

## üöÄ About the Project

The Text Decoder is a web application that provides functionalities to encrypt and decrypt texts. The project was developed to apply programming logic and doesn't focus on advanced UI/UX aspects, maintaining the standard layout provided in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/tvFEYhVfZTjdJ5P24RGV21/Alura-Challenge---Desafio-1---L%C3%B3gica?node-id=16%3A802).

## üìù Instructions

1. Enter your text in the designated field.
2. Choose between the options to encrypt or decrypt.
3. The result will be displayed in the corresponding field.

**Rules:**
- Only lowercase text is allowed.
- Special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, or accents are not allowed.

## üßê How It Works

The program uses a simple substitution logic, transforming vowels into specific syllables. For example:

- The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
- The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

### Main Features

- Encrypt and decrypt texts.
- Button to copy the encryption field.
- Warning for texts that don't meet the rules.
- Responsiveness for mobile.

## üíª Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
